            <li><strong>Cookies: At this time we do not use cookies.</strong> Browser cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites. We use browser cookies to tell us, for example, whether you’ve visited
              us before or if you’re a new visitor and to help us identify website features in which you may have the greatest interest. Browser cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular
              website. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new browser cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new browser cookie, and how to disable existing browser cookies. Remember, without
              browser cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our website features. Cookies are placed on your computer, and accordingly we neither store cookies on our computers nor forward them to any external parties. The information
              that may be maintained by a cookie is used by Dolfin solely to help us manage the website, improve features of the website and understand usage patterns. This may include such items as: username, the pages visited on the website; the date

              to browser cookies, except that they can store data more complex than simple text. Flash cookies, by themselves, cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer. In addition, flash cookies cannot access or remember your email address
              or other personal information unless you provide the information on this website. We use flash cookies to provide you with a better user experience. You can manage and disable flash cookies by clicking http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html

            <li>Web Beacons. This website may also use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Users’ usage of the website and interaction with emails from Dolfin. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize
              certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the Web beacon. We use Web beacons to operate and improve the websites and
